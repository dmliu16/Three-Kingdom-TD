Three Kingdoms Tower Defense

This is a tower defense game, so the main objective is to build soldiers along the path to prevent the enemies from gettign to the castle at the end.

At the beginning of the game, the user can simply click the screen to start. After the game is started, the user will be able to see a map. The user can click on the sword to select map. Currently there are only three maps, and the user has to win the first map in order to play the second one, and so on.

As long as there is enough money, the user can build soldiers along the path. There are swordsmen, archers, and wizards, and each with one upgrade. They all have different attack damage, attack speed, and attack range, so the user can choose which one to build based on the location and scenario.

Also, there are three types of enemies, each with different health and speed.

At the top of the screen the user can see the amount of gold, the number of waves, and the lives that are left. 

The user wins the game if all the waves are finished and there are still lives left. The user loses the game if there are no lives left.

The user can choose to play the next map if wins, and chooses to restart or quit the game if loses.

There are no special libraries required and the user can click the taiji icon at the bottom of the game for help.

Thanks!
